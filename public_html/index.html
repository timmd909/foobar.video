        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>How are my memories returned?</dt>
          <dd>
            You'll be given back all your tapes and as many USB thumbdrives
            as necessary to store all the videos.
          </dd>

          <dt>How much is shipping and handling?</dt>
          <dd>
            I'm not doing that. I'm currently only accepting business from
            people in the Pittsburgh area. Local police stations have
            designated areas under surveillance for doing internet business
            safely. That's what we'll do. It's the safest possible way
            to handoff your VHS tapes. It also avoids $50 or more in shipping
            fees for both of us. Win-win.
          </dd>

          <dt>Are customers charged for unrecoverable VHS tapes?</dt>
          <dd>
            No charge if I'm unable to recover a VHS tape. So far, that's only
            happened one time. The tape itself had become too sticky to allow
            the spindles to rewind or play the tape.
          </dd>

          <dt>Are my memories safe with you?</dt>
          <dd>
            Probably. I only look at the first and last minute to verify that
            the recording went successfully. If you have videos from the 80s
            of you dancing and lip syncing along to Michael Jackson, you need
            not worry if it's in the middle of the tape.
          </dd>

          <dt>What is the turn around time?</dt>
          <dd>
            Videos can usually be processed and shipped back out within
            one week. If you have a large amount of VHS tapes (30+), you're
            probably looking at two weeks.
          </dd>

          <dt>Is there anything I can do about the shaky quality of
            early home movies?</dt>
          <dd>
            Yes. You'll receive a verbatim copy and a stabilized
            version. The old camcorders were painfully heavy on shoulders,
            and arm fatigue was common. My own home movies induced a
            seasick0like nausea before I stabilized them. Everyone
            should be able to share that benefit.
          </dd>
